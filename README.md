# Advanced Database Systems
## Introduction

Welcome to the *Advanced Database Systems* repository. It contains results of my efforts on learning how to design, implement and manage relational and non-relational databases properly. All the projects have been made during my master's degree studies. My work has been divided into steps, where all the details and reports can be found.

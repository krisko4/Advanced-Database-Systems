# Advanced Database Systems
## Introduction

Welcome to the *Advanced Database Systems* repository. It contains results of my efforts on learning how to design, implement and manage relational and non-relational databases properly. All the projects have been made during my master's degree studies. My work is divided into steps, where you can find detailed tasks and reports.
